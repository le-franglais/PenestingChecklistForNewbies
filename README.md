# Pentest Checklist for Security Newbies
## Backstory
First and foremost : this document is for professional and educational purposes only.  These tools and commands should only be used on systems for which expressly written consent is granted by the machine/IP owner.  I am not liable for what you may or may not do with this.

I first started learning about cybersecurity in 2019.  It was new and exciting and complex (and I had no idea what I was doing - just running fast with scissors)..... Spoiler alert : *IT STILL IS - and it always will be*.  That said, I spent a tremendous amount of time figuring things out on my own and leaning on friends and mentors that have forgotten more things than I think I'll know.  Juggling that with a full time job, a large family and a lot of moving pieces wasn't easy.  

As I've started to get a handle on things and I'm knee-deep in OSCP labs, I've come to realize that I need to be more organized. There is ***SO*** much information out there.  This checklist started as an easy way for me to remind myself to not overlook things as I'm going through my process.  It evolved a bit over time to include commands, enumeration techniques, and more.  I've essentially aggregated all my favorite go-to's into one place, and included sources for where I've found things over the years.  

The idea is for this to be a living document.  Some things will get changed, tools will get added and removed, and hopefully it improves - to that end, I welcome any constructive comments.  Ideally, this will be a useful checklist for folks looking to break into the pentesting field, and hopefully you're able to take it and make it your own to fit your needs.  

Remember - Routine, Enumerate, Loot.
